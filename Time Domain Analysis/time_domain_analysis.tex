\section{Current And Voltage Conventions}
\color{black}

The conventions we shall follow, called \textit{\textbf{passive sign conventions}}, simply state that when 
current ``flows into" the positive terminal of the capacitor/inductor, as indicated by the polarity of $v$
in Fig.\ref{fig:conventions}, it is taken as positive. We may then write the current-voltage relations:

\begin{empheq}[box=\widefbox]{align*}
i &= C\frac{dv}{dt}\\
v &= L\frac{di}{dt}
\end{empheq}

\section{First Order Circuits: RL and RC}
\color{black}
A first order circuit is one that is governed by a first order differential equation. Often, it is
incorrectly stated that a first order circuit is one that contains only one energy storage element
(capacitor/inductor). This is wrong, as there are certain arrangements of $R-L$ and $R-C$ circuits
which can be simplified to obtain a first order equation, as we shall see later. So, there being only
one energy storage element in a circuit is a \textit{sufficient} but not \textit{necessary} condition for
it to be first order.

\subsection{The Natural Response}
\subsubsection{The Source-Free RL Circuit}
\color{black}
A \textbf{\textit{natural response}} is one that is free of any external voltage/current sources, 
which are also known as \textit{forcing functions}. It depends on the ``general nature" of the circuit
(types of elements, sizes and interconnections). It is also known as the \textbf{\textit{transient
response}}, as without any external sources, it must eventually die out. Consider the simple series RL
circuit shown in Fig.\ref{fig:src_free_RL}:
\newpage
\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
\begin{circuitikz}[american]
	\draw (0,0) to [R=$R$, v>=$v_R$, voltage shift=2.5] (0,3) to [short, i=$i(t)$] (3,3)
			to [cute inductor, l=$L$, v=$v_L$] (3,0) to [short] (0,0); 
\end{circuitikz}
\caption{Simple R-L circuit for which $i(t)$ is to be determined}
\label{fig:src_free_RL}	
\end{figure}

Let the time varying current be designated $i(t)$, and the value of $i$ at $t=0$ be $I_0$. It may seem 
counter-intuitive to have a non-zero current initially in a circuit with no sources. In order 
for a current to be flowing, a source had to be present at some point of time, but we are only 
bothered with the response of the circuit after $t=0$, 
ie. after the source has been removed. Applying Kirchhoff's
voltage law, we have
\begin{equation*}
Ri + v_L = Ri + L\frac{di}{dt} = 0 
\end{equation*}
or
\begin{equation}
\label{equation:rl_natural}
\frac{di}{dt} + \frac{R}{L}i = 0
\end{equation}
We can separate variables and integrate easily, giving

\begin{equation}
\label{equation:rl_nat_resp}
\boxed{i(t) = I_0e^{-\frac{R}{L}t}}
\end{equation}

where we have incorporated the intitial codition $i(0)=I_0$. The general form of the natural response will 
be
\begin{equation}
\boxed{i(t) = Ke^{-\frac{R}{L}t}}
\end{equation}
where $K$ is a constant, and is nothing but the value of $i$ at $t=0$.

\paragraph{\color{blue}Accounting For The Energy}\mbox{} \\ \mbox{}\\
The power dissipated through the resistor at any time $t$

\begin{equation*}
p_R = i^{2}R = I_0^{2}Re^{-\frac{2Rt}{L}}
\end{equation*}

and the total energy turned into heat by the resistor till the response has died out

\begin{align*}
w_R &= \int_{0}^{\infty} p_R\,dt\\
    &= I_0^{2}R\int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-\frac{2Rt}{L}}\,dt\\
    &= I_0^{2}R\left (\frac{-L}{2R}\right)e^{-\frac{2Rt}{L}}\Biggr|_{0}^{\infty}\\
\Aboxed{w_R &= \frac{1}{2}LI_0^{2}}
\end{align*}
which is the total energy stored initially in the inductor, as expected.

\caption{Some possible plots for the natural response}
\label{fig:nat_resp}
\end{figure}

From the natural response of the series RL circuit given by Eq.\ref{equation:rl_nat_resp}, it is clear that
that the current decays exponentially to zero from an initial value of $I_0$. The graph of $\frac{i}{I_0}$
is plotted in figure \ref{fig:nat_resp} for three different values of $\frac{R}{L}$, as indicated in the legend.

Consider now the initial rate of decay, which is found by differentiating equation \ref{equation:rl_nat_resp}:

\begin{equation*}
\frac{d}{dt}\frac{i}{I_0}\Biggr|_{t=0} = -\frac{R}{L}e^{-Rt/L}\Biggr|_{t=0} = -\frac{R}{L}
\end{equation*}
Assuming that the decay continues at this rate, the time $\uptau$ taken by $\frac{i}{I_0}$ to drop from
$1$ to $0$ is given by
\begin{equation*}
\left(\frac{R}{L}\right)\uptau = 1
\end{equation*}
or
\begin{equation}
\boxed{\uptau = \frac{L}{R}}
\end{equation}
The constant $\uptau$ has the units of seconds and is called the \textbf{time constant} of the circuit.
It may be found graphically from the response curve by drawing the tangent to the curve at $t=0$ and
finding where it intersects the $x$ axis, as shown below:

\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
\begin{tikzpicture}
\begin{axis}[
	ytick={1}, xtick={0,2},
	x label style = {at={(1,0)},anchor=west},
	y label style = {at={(0,1)},rotate=-90,anchor=south},
    axis lines = left,
    xlabel = $t$,
    ylabel = {$\frac{i}{I_0}$},
    ymin = 0, ymax = 1
]

\end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Finding the time constant graphically}
\label{fig:finding_tau_graphically}
\end{figure}

Yet another way to define the time constant is to note that
\begin{equation*}
\frac{i(\uptau)}{I_0} = e^{-1} = 0.3679
\end{equation*}
ie, in one time constant, the response falls to $36.8\%$ of it's initial value. The value of $\uptau$ may
also be determined from this fact:

\begin{figure}[!h]

Figures \ref{fig:prior_t_0} and \ref{fig:post_t_0} show the state of the circuit prior to and post the 
throwing of the switch. In \ref{fig:prior_t_0}, the inductor acts like a short to DC current after all transients have died down.

  \label{fig:post_t_0}
\end{subfigure}
\caption{The simplified circuit before and after the switch is opened}
\label{fig:example_1}
\end{figure}

Applying Kirchhoff's Law in \ref{fig:post_t_0}, we may write 

\begin{align*}
-v + 10i_L + 5\frac{di_l}{dt} &= 0\\
\Rightarrow \frac{5}{40}\frac{dv}{dt} + \left(\frac{10}{40}+1\right)v &= 0\\
\Rightarrow \frac{dv}{dt} + 10v &= 0
\end{align*}
where we have taken $i_l = -v/40$ by our conventions. The solution to this differential equation is
\begin{equation*}
v(t) = v(0^{+})e^{-10t}
\end{equation*}
Note that the initial value of voltage here is denoted by $v(0^{+})$, as the voltage across the resistor 
may change discontinuously when the switch is thrown. We have to use the fact that $i_L$ cannot 
change discontinuously, and remains the same just before and just after the switch is 
thrown. From \ref{fig:prior_t_0}, $i_l(0) = 24/10 = 2.4\text{A}$. Hence, $v(0^{+}) = (40)\cdot(-2.4)=-96\text{V}$, and
so
\begin{equation*}
\boxed{v(t) = -96e^{-10t}}
\end{equation*}
which gives $v(0.2) = -12.99\text{V}$.

\begin{circuitikz}[american]
	\draw (0,0) to [R=$R$, v>=$v_R$, voltage shift=2.5] (0,3) to [short, i=$i(t)$] (3,3)

\end{circuitikz}
\caption{Source-Free RC Circuit}
\label{fig:src_free_RC}	
\end{figure}
The source free response for RC circuits is nearly the same as with LC, but with slightly different 
expressions for the time constant. In this case, the general form of the response is given by

\begin{equation}
\boxed{v(t) = v(0)e^{-\frac{t}{\uptau}}}
\end{equation}

and the expression for the time constant is

\begin{equation}
\boxed{\uptau = R \cdot C}
\end{equation}

It may also be noted that the voltage across a capacitor cannot change discontinuously, as opposed to
the current for an inductor.

\color{blue}
\subsubsection{General RL and RC Circuits}
\color{black}

For circuits containing more than one capacitor/inductor and more than one resistor, it is possible
to arrive at a single time constant and reduce it to a simple circuit with one resistor and one
energy storage element, as long as the Th\'{e}venin resistance ``seen" by all the elements is the same.
In such a case, we can write $\uptau = \frac{L_{eq}}{R_{eq}}$ or $\uptau = R_{eq} \cdot C_{eq}$.
The general form of the natural response would then be $Ae^{-t/\uptau}$, where the constant A 
can be determined using the initial conditions, and would be different for different elements.
Let us illustrate this using the following example:\\

  \caption{The simplified circuit after $t=0$}
  \label{fig:simplified_circ_2}
\end{subfigure}
\label{fig:example_2}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Example:} For the circuit given in figure \ref{fig:example_circ_2} find $i_1$ and $i_L$ for 
$t>0$.\\~\\
Firstly, note that the equivalent/Th\'{e}venin resistance seen by all three inductances is equal, and equal
to $50 + 90||(120 + 60) =110\Omega$. So, we can reduce it to a simple LR circuit, with

\begin{align*}
L_{eq} &= \frac{2 \cdot 3}{2+3} + 1 = 2.2 mH\\
\Rightarrow \uptau &= \frac{L_{eq}}{R_{eq}} = 20\mu s 
\end{align*}
And so every current and voltage in the network must have the form $Ke^{-t/\uptau}=Ke^{-50,000t}$.
If we consider the circuit prior to opening the switch and after all transients have died down, the
inductors act as shorts to DC current and so $i_L$ is easily found to be $i_L = 18/50 = 360mA$. This must
also be the value of $i_L$ just after the switch is opened. So,

\begin{equation*}
i_L = \begin{cases} 
          360 mA & t < 0 \\
          360e^{-50,000t} mA & 0\leq t 
       \end{cases}
\end{equation*}

Now, $i_1$ may change discontiuously at $t=0$ so we have to find it's value at $0^{+}$ using the value of
$i_L(0^+)$. Using current division,

\begin{equation*}
i_1(0^+) = -i_L(0^+) \cdot \frac{120+60}{120+60+90} = -240 mA
\end{equation*}

Hence,

\begin{equation*}
i_1 = \begin{cases} 
          200 mA & t < 0 \\
          -240e^{-50,000t} mA & 0\leq t 
       \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
